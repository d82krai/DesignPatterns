    <b>Difference between "throw" and "throw ex" in C#</b><br />

    <b>throw :</b> If we use "throw" statement, it preserve original error stack information. In exception handling "throw" with empty parameter is also called re-throwing the last exception.
    <br />
    <b>throw ex :</b> If we use "throw ex" statement, stack trace of exception will be replaced with a stack trace starting at the re-throw point. It is used to intentionally hide stack trace information.
